’ll explain how to present Phase 2 (LLM output) in a way that:

does not confuse users

does not undermine Phase 1

makes the LLM feel helpful, not scary

fits naturally into your existing UI

I’ll keep this practical and concrete.

First: the golden UI rule (lock this)

Phase 1 = Facts (authoritative)
Phase 2 = Interpretation (advisory)

The UI must visually and structurally separate them.

If you mix them → trust is lost.

Recommended UI structure (simple & clear)
Top-level navigation

You only need two main tabs:

[ Facts & Evidence ]   [ Insights (LLM) ]


Facts & Evidence → Phase 1 JSON

Insights (LLM) → Phase 2 JSON

Phase 1 should always be the default tab.

1️⃣ Facts & Evidence tab (Phase 1)

This is what you already designed.
It stays unchanged.

Shows:

Cluster overview

Deployments table

HPA table

Node pool table

Drill-down with raw numbers

Safety flags, confidence

This tab answers:

“What is objectively true?”

2️⃣ Insights (LLM) tab (Phase 2)

This tab is read-only, optional, and clearly labeled.

Header (important)

At the top of the tab, show a subtle disclaimer:

Insights generated by LLM
Based on Phase-1 analysis.
For human review only.

This single line sets expectations.

3️⃣ What to show in the Insights tab (exact mapping)
Section A — Cluster Narrative

Source:
insights_output.json.cluster_summary

UI style:

Plain text

3–6 sentences

No badges, no colors

Purpose:

“Tell me what’s going on overall.”

Section B — Detected Patterns

Source:
insights_output.json.patterns[]

UI layout:

Card or list

One pattern per card

Each card shows:

Pattern description

“Affected objects: N”

Click → expand → evidence list

Example:

“Memory over-requests observed in 6 deployments”
Evidence: payments-api, orders-api, billing-api

Purpose:

“What keeps repeating?”

Section C — Warnings

Source:
insights_output.json.warnings[]

UI style:

Table or stacked alerts

Severity badge (Low / Medium / High)

Neutral colors (not alarming red)

Each warning shows:

Severity

Scope (Deployment / Node / Cluster)

Description

Confidence

Expand → evidence list

Purpose:

“What risks should I be aware of?”

Section D — Action Candidates (very important how you present this)

Source:
insights_output.json.action_candidates[]

⚠️ Do NOT label this as “Actions”

Call it:

“Things to Review”

“Candidate Areas for Review”

Each item shows:

Description

Expected impact (text)

Prerequisites

Blocked by (if any)

Confidence

❌ No buttons
❌ No “Apply”
❌ No links to change things

Purpose:

“Where might I want to spend time investigating?”

Section E — Priorities

Source:
insights_output.json.priorities

Display as:

Short paragraph

Ordered explanation

Purpose:

“Why these items appear above others.”

Section F — Limitations

Source:
insights_output.json.limitations[]

This is critical for trust.

Display as:

Bulleted list

Slightly muted style

Example:

“Some deployments lack sufficient traffic”

“Node metrics incomplete for pool X”

Purpose:

“What the LLM could not be confident about.”

4️⃣ Cross-linking back to Phase 1 (trust booster)

Whenever possible:

Deployment name → clickable → opens Phase-1 deployment detail

Node pool → opens Phase-1 node view

Evidence strings → expandable raw evidence

This reinforces:

“LLM is explaining the facts, not inventing them.”

5️⃣ What NOT to show (important)

❌ No charts invented by LLM
❌ No numeric values not present in Phase 1
❌ No confidence percentages
❌ No cost savings numbers
❌ No auto-generated remediation steps

Those come later (if ever).

6️⃣ Minimal UI wiring (technical, simple)

UI loads:

analysis_output.json (always)

insights_output.json (if exists & valid)

If insights file is missing or invalid:

Hide Insights tab

Or show “Insights not available”

This keeps Phase 1 independent and robust.

7️⃣ One-sentence UX principle (remember this)

The UI should feel like a report reviewed by an expert, not advice given by a tool.

If it feels like advice → tone it down.
If it feels like explanation → you nailed it.
