    "description": "Comprehensive Phase 2 validator rewrite: implemented 8 validation layers (structural, type, warnings, action_candidates, safety cross-checks with Phase 1). New schema enforces 6 required top-level keys (cluster_summary, patterns, warnings, action_candidates, priorities, limitations) with strict field validation. Safety layer prevents resize actions on unsafe deployments and requires limitations to reference insufficient_data from Phase 1. All 60 tests passing."

    "description": "Phase 3 Web UI complete redesign: Changed port from 5000 to 8080. Redesigned dashboard with comprehensive 3-tab interface. TAB 1 (Facts & Evidence): 6 sections - Cluster Overview, Cluster Patterns, Deployments Table, Deployment Details (drill-down), HPA Analysis, Node Pools. TAB 2 (Insights LLM): 6 sections - Cluster Summary, Patterns Detected, Warnings, Action Candidates, Prioritization, Limitations. TAB 3 (Raw JSON): Toggle buttons for analysis_output.json and insights_output.json. Design principle: Phase 1 shows the truth (facts), Phase 2 explains the truth (insights), UI never mixes them. All sections follow strict separation with color-coded badges, tables, drill-downs, and responsive layout."
