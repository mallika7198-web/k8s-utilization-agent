New schema enforces 6 required top-level keys (cluster_summary, patterns, warnings, action_candidates, priorities, limitations) with strict field validation. Safety layer prevents resize actions on unsafe deployments and requires limitations to reference insufficient_data from Phase 1. All 60 tests passing."

TAB 1 (Facts & Evidence): 6 sections - Cluster Overview, Cluster Patterns, Deployments Table, Deployment Details (drill-down), HPA Analysis, Node Pools. TAB 2 (Insights LLM): 6 sections - Cluster Summary, Patterns Detected, Warnings, Action Candidates, Prioritization, Limitations. TAB 3 (Raw JSON): Toggle buttons for analysis_output.json and insights_output.json. Design principle: Phase 1 shows the truth (facts), Phase 2 explains the truth (insights), UI never mixes them. All sections follow strict separation with color-coded badges, tables, drill-downs, and responsive layout."

Short-term - replaced print() with structured logging, added retry logic to Prometheus client (3 retries with exponential backoff), added /health and /ready endpoints for K8s probes, added LLM API key support, added config validation on startup. Medium-term - added LRU caching for Prometheus queries, added /metrics endpoint for self-monitoring, created comprehensive test suite with 67 passing tests covering config, prometheus_client, llm_client, validator, and ui modules. Fixed datetime.utcnow() deprecation warnings."

Added fragmentation thresholds (DAEMONSET_OVERHEAD_THRESHOLD_PERCENT=15, LARGE_POD_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_PERCENT=25, FRAGMENTATION_THRESHOLD=0.3). Created analysis/fragmentation_attribution.py module with 4 attribution functions: large_request_pods (pods consuming >25% of node resources), constraint_blockers (pods with topology/affinity constraints), daemonset_overhead (DaemonSet resource consumption), scale_down_blockers (pods preventing node drain). Integrated into node_analysis.py with second-pass attribution for nodes exceeding fragmentation threshold. Added 13 comprehensive tests (80 total now passing)."
